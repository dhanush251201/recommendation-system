```python
import necessary PySpark libraries

Define schema for movie ratings data
Load movie ratings data from a file using the defined schema
Inspect the dataset by printing its schema and examining the first few rows

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing)

Initialize an ALS recommendation model
Train the model on the training data with parameters (e.g., maxIter, regParam, userCol, itemCol, ratingCol)

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data
Calculate RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate the model's performance

Check for NaN predictions and handle them (e.g., replace with average rating)

Define schema for movie details data
Load movie details data from a file using the defined schema

Generate top N movie recommendations for each user
Display the results, optionally including movie details

Generate top N user recommendations for each movie
Display the results, optionally including user and movie details

Demonstrate how to generate user recommendations for a specific set of movies
Display the results, optionally including user and movie details
